1. (5 points) Start with an array called inputtable. The array should have numbers between
1 and 10.  
2. (30 points) Use inputtable from step 1 to create the following: -
a. Set of multiples of 5 between 1 and 51. Name it fiveTable, print the contents to the console
b. Set of multiples of 13 between 1 and 131. Name it thirteenTable, print the contents to the console
c. Set of squares of the numbers in inputtable. Name it squaresTable, print the contents to the console
3. (10 points) Get (and then print) the odd multiples of 5 between 1 and 100. 5, 15, ...
4. (20 points) Get (and then print) the sum of even multiples of 7 between 1 and 100.
Example: find the multiples and then sum them: 14 + 28+...  
5. (15 points) Use currying to rewrite the function below:
function cylinder_volume(r, h){ 
var volume = 3.14 * r * r * h; 
return volume; 
} 
a. Use r = 5 and h = 10 to call your curried function.
b. Reuse the function from part ‘a’ but use h = 17
c. Reuse the function from part ‘a’ but use h = 11 -

6.  (15 points) Use the following code to take advantage of closures to wrap content with
HTML tags, specifically show an HTML table consisting of a table row that has at least
one table cell/element. You can use the console to output your results.
